In this paper we analyse multiple daily precipitation statistics (with a particular attention towards extremes) in a set of 9 EURO-CORDEX Regional Climate Models at two different spatial scales (~50 and 12km). For comparison, 9 regional high resolution observational dataset, covering most of Europe, are considered. The question of added value is thoroughly discussed.
