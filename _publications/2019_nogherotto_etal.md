This paper, first authored by Rita Nogherotto, describes our three-model chain (climate + hydrological + hydraulic) to simulate flood hazard over the Po river basin. This approach has since then been extended to the comeplete Italian territory. Additionally, a case study is presented to validate our findings. This is still a work in progress, but we hope it'll be sumbitted shortly.
