I was born in Belluno, Italy in 1990, where I lived until I had to move for university. I now live in Trieste together with my girlfriend and our wonderful daughter, born in 2010.

Living in Belluno for the most part of my youth left me with a constitutional and unconditioned love for mountains. I love climbing, trekking and hiking, and always find refuge in mountaineering when possible.

I like to get my hands dirty with building, fixing and (often) wrecking things: I maintain my car myself and greatly enjoy woodworking and electronics.

I also love coding and messing with computers. In particular I have large experience with Linux, which I have been using since 2007. I recently built my own small home server, which runs on ArchLinux (my favourite distribution) and provides a Steam cache (my favourite modern game is Dota2, which I often play with friends), video and music streaming (with Plex) and cloud storage (with NextCloud) for my family. The server sits in our bedroom, so the challenge was to make it almost completely silent: this was accomplished by building a small wooden, noise-absorbing case around one large 20cm Noctua fan. Most of the time the fan is off, and the system uses natural convection for cooling.
