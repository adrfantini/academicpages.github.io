I was born in Belluno, Italy in 1990, where I lived until I had to move for university. I now live in Trieste together with my girlfriend and our wonderful daughter, born in 2010.

Living in Belluno for the most part of my youth left me with a constitutional and unconditioned love for mountains. I love climbing, trekking and hiking, and always find refuge in mountaineering when possible.

I like to get my hands dirty with building, fixing and (often) wrecking things: I maintain my car myself and greatly enjoy woodworking and electronics.

I also love coding and messing with computers. In particular I have large experience with Linux-based Operative Systems, which I have been using since 2007. I recently built my own low-power home server, which runs on ArchLinux; you can find more info [here](https://adrfantini.github.io/server/).
I also enjoy video games: my favourite modern game is [Dota2](www.dota2.com), which I play with friends weekly.
